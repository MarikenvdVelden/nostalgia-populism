abstract: "_This paper explores nostalgia's persuasive role in political rhetoric, examining its influences across the ideological spectrum. While traditionally associated with right-wing populism, we argue that nostalgia also resonates with the left. To address conceptual overlaps between populism, nationalism, and nostalgia, we adopt a broader approach, encompassing sentimental longing for personal, in-group, or national pasts, regardless of what people are nostalgic for. This approach enables a fuller understanding of nostalgia's impact on campaign rhetoric. We find: a) conceptual overlap between populism and a subtype of nostalgia grieving for a lost national identity (reluctant nostalgia); b) voters across ideological spectrums have nostalgic attitudes using this broader approach; and c) while individuals are persuaded by nostalgic messages from those similar to them, such messages decrease support for in-party messages. This paper, thereby, emphasizes the necessity of comprehensively grasping nostalgia to fully comprehend its impact on political campaigning._"

# Introduction

Populists seemingly make hay with slogans like "*Make America great again!*" (Donald Trump), "*Take back control!*" (UKIP), or "*Turn back the clock to times before the country was being stolen from them*" (US Tea Party). 
What these slogans have in common is that a) they all critique the current way of life and yearn for the times before society has undergone said changes; and b) they are made by right-wing populist parties or party leaders. 
At the same time, left-wing leaders, like Jean-Luc Mélenchon (*La France Insoumise*), also reminisce about the hope that lies in the past [@buffery2012].
Looking at rhetoric used by US presidential candidates during election campaigns, Democrats did not use any less nostalgic rhetoric than Conservatives did [@bonikowski2022reclaiming]. 
For example, democrats use pre-globalization nostalgia [@ballard2024trade]. 
Moreover, in the EU referendum campaign, the Remain side argued that staying in the EU reflected a continuity of British history [@gaston2018home].
Also, after the UK's Labour party's historic decline in the 2010's, the party strategists suggested to look for "electoral support by proposing reconnection with (what is left of) the traditional working class on the basis of a nostalgic longing for a lost communitarian past" [@davis2011tangled, p.36].
This thus showcases that nostalgia takes center stage in political communication.
While political actors frequently employ symbolic politics by capitalizing on symbolic matters through historic narratives [@dinas2024; @rozenas2022real; @lupu2003memory; @forest2011monumental], left-leaning politicians do not seem to achieve the same level of success with using nostalgic rhetoric as right-wing politicians do. 
This begs the question of _when and for whom is nostalgia a persuasive rhetorical style?_


Nostalgia, coming from the Greek words _nostos_ (home) and _algia_ (pain or sorrow), means so much as a "pain of loss" or a "pleasant memory".
Regardless of the more positive -- "pleasant memory" -- or the more negative -- "pain of loss" -- conception, nostalgia is centrally concerned with loss [@pickering2006modalities]. 
Loss sounds to have a closer link with a more conservative political ideology, with its general desire to preserve the societal status-quo or to return society to its traditional way of being.
Many studies, indeed, have empirically established the link between the (populist) right and feelings of nostalgia [e.g. @smeekes2021longing; @smeekes2015longing; @steenvoorden2018appeal; @elcci2022politics; @vanprooijen2022make; @versteegen2023those; @betz2004against; @elgenius2022nationalism; @elgenius2019frames].
We argue that there are two issues with these findings, rooted in the used measurement of nostalgia. 
First, the often used scale of collective nostalgia [@smeekes2015longing; @sedikides2019sociality; @wohl2020longing] partially resembles nationalist measures of populist attitudes [e.g. see @akkerman2014populist; @meijers2022people] in its phrasing and therefore partly captures different dimensions of the same concept.^[Yet, the study by @vanprooijen2022make does find that manipulating populist items affects nostalgic attitudes and not the other way around.]
Second, political leaders can evoke nostalgia for a past era in their narratives by coupling it with scapegoating. 
For example, populist leaders blame specific groups, such as immigrants, minorities, or political elites, for the perceived decline from an idealized past.
Experimental studies mimic this reality by incorporating a scapegoat in their nostalgic treatment [e.g. @vanprooijen2022make; @elcci2022politics].
By scapegoating particular groups, e.g. immigrants, the focus shifts away from addressing complex contemporary issues and places the blame on external factors, which coincides with an issue position [@bonikowski2023populism]. 
Both the conceptual overlap with populism through the confounding dimension of nationalism and the collusion with issue positions does not allow us to conclude that the nostalgic element in the political communication drives the effects described in the studies on the (populist) right and feelings of nostalgia.

Research shows that nostalgia is experienced by people from all ideological stripes [@stefaniak2021different; @lammers2018past]. 
_What_ they are nostalgic for, however, differs:
Conservatives are nostalgic for a more homogeneity-focused society -- i.e. a desire for more social distance towards out-groups -- aligning with the restoration of heartland values, beloved by populists [@taggart2004populism], whereas liberals yearn for a more openness-focused society -- i.e. related to a desire for less social distance towards out-groups [@stefaniak2021different].
These different longings should be reflected in the measurement of nostalgia. 
The most used scale, collective nostalgia, however, does only reflext the more homogeneity-focused society  [@smeekes2015longing; @sedikides2019sociality; @wohl2020longing].
Additionally, the psychological characteristics of nostalgia -- being that nostalgia gives psychological comfort [@sedikides2018finding; @routledge2011past], intrinsically motivates people [@may2017belonging; @van2019nostalgia; @sedikides2018finding], and reduces inter-group prejudices [@lammers2018past; @wohl2020longing] -- seem ideally suited for a campaign rhetoric that bolsters message support. 
We, therefore, put forward that *nostalgia is a persuasive rhetorical style political actors across the ideological spectrum have in their toolkit to successfully persuade voters*.

To substantiate our argument, we explore different conceptions of the past that voters yearn for using a broader conceptualization of nostalgia -- i.e. one tested and validated in the fields of sociology and marketing studies [@pickering2006modalities; @may2017belonging; @hartmann2019nostalgia].^[While we acknowledge that this broader conception of nostalgia is correlated with right-wing ideology -- it is, see our [Online Compendium](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md)-- or argument is that it encompasses more types of nostalgia, i.e. also the types of bitter sweet memories of people from the left [@stefaniak2021different].] 
Specifically, we look at three dimensions:
Reluctant, progressive, and playful nostalgia. 
Reluctant nostalgia encapsulates a yearning for a past era that is often associated with a specific national identity.
Individuals experiencing this type of nostalgia may often mourn the loss of what is perceived as a stronger, more cohesive national identity. 
The measures of reluctant nostalgia are very similar to those of collective nostalgia [@smeekes2015longing; @sedikides2019sociality; @wohl2020longing], and thus reflect ties to historical events, cultural traditions or a shared sense of purpose that defined a given nation in the past. 
Progressive nostalgia, on the other hand, is a reflective form of nostalgia that engages in an ongoing dialogue between the past and the present as it recognizes that both are interconnected. 
It seeks to draw lessons or inspirations from historical experiences to inform a more open and forward-looking collective future [@wohl2020longing; @stefaniak2021different]. 
Rather than being focused on a specific era or tradition, it embraces diversity, inclusivity, and adaptive capacities and uses lessons from the past to foster positive change. 
Playful nostalgia engages with cultural markers of one's youth (e.g. music, films) and overlaps with the concept of personal nostalgia [@sedikides2019sociality]. 
It emphasizes the significance of individual memories and experiences in shaping one's sense of self and well-being. 

We use the *VU Election Studies 2023* (van der Velden, 2023) -- a unique five-wave panel conducted between 11 January 2023 and 30 March 2023 in the Netherlands by KiesKompas, a Dutch-polling company. 
We see the Netherlands as a hard test for the persuasiveness of nostalgia as an affective rhetorical style, because a) while increasing, affective polarization is not as high as in many other countries [@harteveld2021fragmented]; and b) parties do not frequently engage in nostalgic rhetoric [@mueller2023nostalgia] -- i.e. voters are barely pre-treated. 

Using this Dutch data, we conduct three studies. 
First, using PCA, we show that there is considerable overlap between reluctant nostalgia and populist attitudes, but not between populist attitudes and other forms of nostalgia (i.e. playful and progressive nostalga).
We thereby provide evidence for a wider conceptualization of nostalgia than thus-far used in studies of political science and political communication. 
Second, using qualitative content analysis, we demonstrate that indeed voters of populist parties score higher on reluctant nostalgia, but across the ideological spectrum people hold especially playful and progressive nostalgic feelings.
This means that previous work that linked populism to nostalgia seems to take only into account a specific type of nostalgia, while other types of nostalgia might be more relevant for left-wing politics.
Third, in a preregistered vignette experiment,^[Our [online compendium](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md) combines the data and the preregistration.] we show that overall respondents like nostalgic messages, but not more so than non-nostalgic messages.
While they do not think this is the right message for them, respondents do think that a nostalgic message is the best for people like them.
This aligns with what is known as the third person effect in communication science and psychology, meaning that people tend to perceive that mediated messages have a greater effect on others than on themselves, based on personal biases [@davison1983third].
Exploring heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that nostalgic messages actually reduce support for messages coming from in-party campaigns, and that reduction is even stronger for conservative respondents. 

This study makes several important theoretical and empirical contributions. 
First, in the field of the political communication, we theorise and find evidence that the central role nostalgia plays in political communication goes way beyond the concept of collective nostalgia [@smeekes2015longing; @sedikides2019sociality; @wohl2020longing].
The nostalgic desire to "return to community" is present across the ideological spectrum, although often not only reluctant but also progressive and playful. 
All in all, nostalgia evokes a sense of belonging, which is pivotal for people to carry out their democratic citizenship [@blajer2023conceptualizing]. 
Second, this paper contributes to research on rhetorical persuasiveness.
Our empirical findings provide a nuanced understanding on the extent to which nostalgia can be effective to engage voters.
We show that even if thinking nostalgia is persuasive is a commonplace across voters from different ideologies, it does not increase the liking of in-party political messages.
We posit that the findings of our research hold key implications for contemporary democratic societies and the well-being of individuals. 
Based on the shared misperception that nostalgia is an effective tool for political persuasion, political actors might be exacerbating social divisions and individuals' disatisfaction. 
On one hand, nostalgia, particularly of the reluctant variety, has the potential to heighten inter-group tensions [@smeekes2015longing]. 
This effect can polarize communities, as it often romanticizes a past that excludes certain groups, thereby exacerbating divisions within society. 
On the other hand, our results suggest that nostalgia can adversely impact individual well-being and the quality of social interactions [@sedikides2008nostalgia; @juhl2010fighting]. 

# Does Longing for the Past Mobilize? And for Whom?

Nostalgia is a multifaceted emotion, encompassing elements of self-relevance, bittersweetness, a social dimension, and a focus on the past [@sedikides2018finding;@sedikides2019sociality;@heath2022evolution;@pickering2006modalities]. 
These facets make it a complex and intriguing emotional experience. 
Feelings of nostalgia are not solely an individual affair, but are often deeply intertwined with collective social contexts [@wildschut2014collective; @pickering2006modalities]. 
Moreover, they are frequently described as a group-based emotion linked to social identity theory, emphasizing the connection between nostalgia and our sense of belonging [@tajfel1979integrative; @psaltis2017social]. 
In this way, nostalgia can accentuate in-group versus out-group distinctions, emphasizing the boundaries that exist between the 'authentic us' and the 'alien them' [@elcci2022politics].

In recent years, scholars in the fields of political science and political communication have directed increasing attention to the concept of nostalgia. 
Their focus often centers on reluctant (or collective) nostalgia, which is defined as 'the nostalgic reverie that is contingent upon thinking of oneself in terms of a particular social identity or as a member of a particular group, and concerns events or objects related to it' [@wildschut2014collective, p. 845]. 
Reluctant nostalgia may fixate on events that were either experienced by individuals themselves [@baldwin2018nostalgia], or preserved through collective memory, passed down within families, learned from books, or narrated by the mass media [@kao2012exploratory]. 
Reluctant nostalgia tends to be more pronounced when individuals perceive their group as having been better off in the past compared to the present [@cheung2017nostalgia]. 
Additionally, it exhibits a remarkable consistency among individuals within the same generation of the same cultural group [@kao2012exploratory]. 
This underscores the enduring impact of reluctant nostalgia in shaping our collective narratives and identities.
Scholars delving into the realm of politics often draw associations between nostalgia and either populism or nationalism. Populist leaders frequently incorporate nostalgic elements into their rhetoric to craft a narrative centered around 'an abandoned but undead past,' which serves as a hallmark of the populist heartland [@elcci2022politics; @taggart2004populism; @bauman2017retrotopia]. Through this, they construct an image of a bygone era when life was ostensibly better for their in-group, now seemingly imperiled by the out-group.

Numerous studies have empirically substantiated the connection between feelings of nostalgia, especially on the political right, and the rise of populism [e.g. @smeekes2021longing; @smeekes2015longing; @steenvoorden2018appeal; @elcci2022politics; @vanprooijen2022make; @versteegen2023those; @betz2004against; @elgenius2022nationalism; @elgenius2019frames]. 
However, a closer examination is necessary concerning the methodology and design of these studies.
When scrutinizing the measures of nostalgia employed by @smeekes2015longing, it becomes evident that the survey items repeatedly reference the Dutch people and society of the past. 
These items not only overlap with feelings of nativism, nationalism, and relative deprivation, but also present Dutch society and people as homogeneous, akin to the ideational approach of conceptualizing populism [@mudde2004populist], as reflected in the measurements introduced by @akkerman2014populist [see @meijers2022people for an elaboration on how the use of words can probe more nativism in these items]. 
Notably, @mudde2018studying observed that if collective nostalgia were operationalized in a way that captures more aspects seen as socialist, the populist left might identify with it as strongly as the populist right.
Furthermore, research indicates that politicians of different ideologies resort to nostalgic rhetoric [@mueller2023nostalgia], and that both conservatives and liberals experience nostalgia [@stefaniak2021different]. 
Hence, politicians from across the political spectrum can harness nostalgic rhetoric to garner support and mobilize voters. 
As such, nostalgia emerges not merely as a facet of populism or nationalism but rather as a versatile element that politicians of any ideology can wield in their pursuit of public support and electoral success.

In sum, the potential theoretical overlap between nostalgia and populism calls for a reassessment of the existing evidence on the impact of nostalgia on populist attitudes. 
If certain measures encompass distinct facets of a shared concept, it becomes necessary to consider that some findings may inherently possess tautological qualities. 
Consequently, we put forth the hypothesis that nostalgia represents an attitude distinct from populist attitudes.

>**H1**: *Populist attitudes are conceptually related to reluctant nostalgia, but not to other dimensions of nostalgia (i.e progressive and playful nostalgia).*

The universal nature of nostalgia stems from its psychological foundation, enabling it to resonate with a broad spectrum of individuals.
Such attitudes encapsulate personal past moments and culturally significant experiences. 
Previously defined collective nostalgia manifests in various forms, often correlating with different social in-groups.
Threats to an in-group's stability often induce nostalgia [@byrne2007england; @smeekes2015longing]. 
Nostalgic feelings offer solace by fostering the belief in the group's enduring core values across changing times [@sani2010self].
Notably, these memories may not always be accurate reflections of past events but are often idealized versions, emphasizing positive aspects while dismissing the less favorable ones  [@pickering2006modalities]. Such memories serve less as a desire to revert to the past and more as a rejection of the future [@gaston2018home], primarily when comparisons with the present induce feelings of relative deprivation [@versteegen2023those].

Disruptive societal changes, like significant migration flows, typically elicit nostalgia.
Although a substantial portion of research in political communication and psychology emphasizes nativist in-group and out-group dynamics [e.g. @smeekes2021longing; @elcci2022politics], broader research in social psychology and sociology indicates a more extensive application of in-group threats, such as the decline of the working class [@heath2022evolution]. 
Current findings suggest nostalgia is less about political inclination and more associated with individual personality traits [@stefaniak2022us].
This insight givesx rise to our next expectation:

>**H2**: *Citizens, irrespective of their ideological leanings, exhibit nostalgic attitudes.*

Political campaigns often leverage the power of nostalgia. 
Donald Trump's "*Make America Great Again*" and Geert Wilders' "*The Netherlands Ours Again*" tap into a collective memory, painting a picture of a glorious past. 
However, this tactic is not exclusively right-wing. 
Left-leaning campaigns, like that of *Die Linke* in Germany and Melenchon in France, have similarly embraced nostalgia.
The joint campaign slogan "*Netherlands moving forward again*" for the Dutch Elections in 2023 by *PvdA-GroenLinks* further exemplifies nostalgia's broad usage. 
These instances suggest that political parties, regardless of their ideological leanings, recognize the universal appeal of nostalgia as an enhancer of message persuasiveness.
A nostalgic undertone in political messaging often resonates with voters because it taps into deeply rooted grievances. 
These grievances, both economic and cultural, have been linked to the rise in populist support [@ivarsflaten2008unites; @bale2010if; @steenvoorden2018appeal].
Furthermore, exposure to populist rhetoric with nostalgic undertones can increase populist attitudes among audiences [@elcci2022politics; @vanprooijen2022make].
Liberal values framed nostalgically can even foster greater support and reduce group disagreements [@lammers2018past]. 
The research by @smeekes2021longing suggests that nostalgia could be the new master-frame for right-wing populist parties as it speaks directly to cultural grievances.
While nostalgia might be potent in populist rhetoric, its use extends beyond nativist or populist boundaries. 
Political actors across the spectrum capitalize on the emotional tug of nostalgia to legitimize or de-legitimize policies and cultivate national pride. 
The appeal often arises from constructing a moment in the past as ideal. 
This reconstruction takes the form of brief and multivocal statements, creatively blending frames from the prevailing political culture [@bonikowski2023populism].
Nostalgic rhetoric is particularly favored by challengers in the US [@bonikowski2023populism]. 
A comprehensive analysis of party manifestos across European democracies from 1946 to 2018 revealed that nostalgia is employed across the board, with a higher prevalence among parties with a culturally conservative position [@mueller2023nostalgia].
In conclusion, nostalgia serves as a rhetoricl tool to garner support for messages in political communication. 
Its potency lies in its universal appeal and its ability to resonate with a broad spectrum of voters. 
Political actors, recognizing this power, often incorporate nostalgic elements into their messaging, hoping to bolster support and drive their agendas. 
Nostalgia, as a psychological sentiment, adds a potent layer to this messaging, often making political communication more affective and resonant. 
Our argument is that nostalgia works in a similar way rhetorically, making political messages more palatable to a broader audience.

>**H3**: *A nostalgically framed political message will increase support for the message vis-a-vis a non-nostalgically framed political message.* 


# Data, Measures, and Methods of Estimation
To investigate whether nostalgic communication is a feature of populist rhetoric or whether it is a persuasive rhetorical style for all voters, we have conducted two studies within the VU Election Studies 2023 (van der Velden, 2023). 
This is a five-wave panel survey, conducted between 11 January 2023 and 20 March 2023 by KiesKompas, a Dutch-polling company. 
The panel is conducted by KiesKompas' VIP panel, a group of dedicated panel members, who do not receive compensation. 
The panel is an opt-in sample, yet representative based on demographic variables. 
The data presented in this paper comes from the first and the fourth wave -- 11 January 2023 till 18 January 2023 and 7 till 14 March 2023. 
During the first wave, participants were asked about their political preferences, their nostalgic attitudes, their populist attitudes, and were asked to fill in an open-ended question about what time in the past they are nostalgic for, among other questions. 
In the fourth wave, we included an experiment in order to disentangle nostalgic messages from ideological ones. 
In the first wave, `2,185` participants completed the survey, in the fourth wave `1,560` participants completed the survey. 
These waves where chosen due to availability in the broader election project.
We have used the recommendation of Gerber and Green (2011) to impute missing values with the mean value per wave, and indicate whether a variable has more than ten percent missing values.^[Our analytical code is available on our Online Compendium: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md] 
While there are more sophisticated methods for imputation, e.g. machine learning techniques [@thomas2021systematic], the difference in results do not outweigh the efforts.
We report the results with imputed missing values, but our [Online Compendium](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md) also presents the analyses without imputed values, and these results are substantively similar.


## Study 1 & 2: Observational Data

We use the first wave of the VU Elections Studies data to a) employ a measurement model (PCA) to establish the conceptual overlap between populist attitudes and reluctant measures of nostalgia, i.e. those conceptions of nostalgia that are coherent with nationalism; 
and b) explore the various other conceptions of nostalgia originating from the sociological and marketing literature.

                            "More immigrant and female politicians",

```

***Variables for Measurement Models.*** 
We measure *populist attitudes* using nine statements assembled by KiesKompas based on a meta-analysis of all populist items (KiesKompas 2020). 
Table \ref{tab:mm-items} displays these nine items as well as the mean and standard deviation of these items. 
Participants were asked on a five-point Likert scale, where `1` equals fully disagree and `5` equals fully agree, the extent to which they agreed with those statements. 
Statements 3 and 5 are reversed coded. 
We subsequently measure *nostalgic attitudes* using the question *"Below are some things that have changed in the last 50 years. Do you think these things make modern life worse or better?"* [@heath2022evolution]. 
We use eleven items, displayed in Table \ref{tab:mm-items}, that are scored on *makes life worse* (value of `1`), *makes no difference* (value of `2`), or *makes life better* (value of `3`). 
Based on arguments made in other fields [@richards2019westminster], the measures are expected to consist of three different, but related, subcategories. 
Nostalgia attitude items 3, 6, and 9 are expected to indicate a more playful, and less political, form of nostalgia. 
Agreement (or indicating that life is better off with these circumstances; indicated by a higher score) with nostalgic attitude items 1,2, and 11 would indicate a progressive, and potentially left-leaning, form of nostalgia. 
Reversely, lower scores on nostalgic attitude items 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 are indicative of a more reluctant, and thus closely tied to nationalistic, form of nostalgia. 

***Coding of Open Ended Question.*** 
Respondents where also asked the open ended question *What moment in history do you most long for?* 
Based on reading the first 100 responses, we created a codebook consisting of nostalgic categories: personal youth, solidary society, pre-polarized society, pre-industrialized society, colonialism, anti-Europe, and nationalism. 
Table \ref{tab:nosttimes} shows the different categories together with an illustrative example of an open-ended question response in accordance wit the respective category. 
To assess the inter-coder reliability, a total of 50 responses to the open-ended questions were coded by two independent coders.
This resulted in reliability values using Krippendorff's $\alpha$ of `0.85`.

```{r nostt-open, topcaption=TRUE}
df <- tibble(Category = c("Colonialism","Euroskeptic","Nationalism","Solidary Society", "Personal Youth",  "Pre-Industrialized Society", "Pre-Polarized Society"),

                                "Before the European unification and our Florin/Guilder!",
                                "The moment when the Netherlands was not yet flooded with different languages, cultures and dubious norms and values.",
                                "To the moment when we said hello to each other on the street and people looked out for each other. Nowadays everyone lives on his/her own island",
                                "To my childhood, you knew nothing, no war or whatever",
                                "Prehistoric times: Possibly man could have developed in a different way, which would have benefited nature",
                                "Towards a democracy with less polarization and fewer political parties"))

## Study 3: Experimental Data

In a follow-up study, conducted with the same participants as the observational study, we conduct an experiment in which we cue nostalgic values and scapegoats, to test our core argument that nostalgia is a rhetorical style political actors across the ideological spectrum have in their toolkit to successfully persuade voters.


***Experimental Procedure*** 
The experimental procedure was as follows (visualized in Figure \ref{fig:procedure}):
We first split up participants into an ideological group -- either left-wing progessive or right-wing conservative.
We do this, because the object of what people are nostalgic for differs over the ideological positoins [@stefaniak2021different; @lammers2018past].
Based on ideological self-selection, using a five-point Likert scale to classify whether respondents would classify themselves as *very progressive*, *progressive*, *center*, *conservative*, or *very conservative*, we classified people into belonging to either a left-wing progressive or right-wing conservative leaning group.
For each ideological group, we created messages based on the narratives coming from the open ended questions as well as based on the reviewed literature in sociology and marketing. 
Respondents that categorize themselves as center, conservative or very conservative were shown the right-wing conservative treatments.^[As a robustness check, we run the analyses with and without the people who classify themselves as centrists, and this does not substantively affect the results.]
Respondents that categorize themselves as progressive, or very progressive were shown the left-wing progressive treatments. 
Messages can either be nostalgic or not, as well as consist of a scapegoat or not (i.e. a `2*2` design) -- creating four experimental groups, see our [Online Compendium](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md).
We randomized respondents into seeing one of four different potential campaign messages (see Figure \ref{fig:procedure}), telling respondents that a party close to their position is testing campaigning material for the next Dutch elections. 
An example of the treatment text for a left-wing voter including nostalgia and a scapegoat reads as follows: 
_Looking back, we remember a time when solidarity, workers rights, and respect for the environment were paramount. People lived a slow and peaceful life in harmony with nature, valuing community over individualism. Today, we see a world plagued by pollution, polarization, and stress, caused in large part by large corporations, contamination lobbyists and neo-liberal policy makers. It's time to hold them accountable again for their actions and reclaim those values of solidarity, respect, and peace that made our world a better place. Let's create a world where workers' rights are protected again, the environment is re-cherished, and the well-being of all people is prioritized again over the interests of a select few._

```

***Dependent Variables.*** 
To test the support for nostalgic messages in H3, we first asked respondents on an eleven-point scale, where `0` is totally disagree and `10` is totally agree, the extent to which they agreed with the statement they just read (i.e. the experimental treatment). 
As a follow up, we asked respondents to select the campaign message their in-party should pick because a) it fits you best; b) it fits the general Dutch voters best; and c) it fits left-wing/ right-wing voters best. 
Respondents could select any of the four texts we created for the experiment (see our [Online Compendium](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md)).

***Control Variables.*** Based on a balance test (see our [Online Compendium](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md) for details), we included unbalanced demographic co-variates as well as the ideological tone of the experimental message, and whether it was a nostalgic and/or scapegoat message into our analysis.

# Message Support and Nostalgic Rhetoric

To systematically assess our key argument that nostalgic rhetoric is a strategic rhetorical style that can be used by politicians of all ideological stripes to bolster support for their messages, we first empirically demonstrate that the so-far theorized and demonstrated relationship between populist support/ populist attitudes and nostalgia is based on a conceptual overlap between a particular vision of the past (i.e. a homogeneity-focused society) and populism, both being routed in nationalistic attitudes and the idea of a society focussed on homogeneity. 
Second, we descriptively explore the types of nostalgic attitudes people have and whether these attitudes, in a broader conception than the homogeneity-focused society one, is primarily preserved for those with populist attitudes/supporters of populist parties. 
Finally, leveraging an experimental `2*2` design, we cue nostalgic values as well as scapegoats, to test our core argument that nostalgic rhetoric is persuasive across different ideological positions. 

## Do Populism and Nostalgia Measure the Same?

To measure the empirical overlap between *Populist Attitudes* and *Nostalgic Attitudes* (H1), we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), using all nine populist and eleven nostalgic survey items.^[Before conducting the PCA, we did calculated a correlation table, see our Online Compendium, showing that the two items on populist items that encompass the core dimensions of *sovereignty of the people* and an *anti-elitist* and *anti-pluralist*, is negatively correlated with a nostalgic factor that would indicate a high degree of progressiveness (as the responses on these survey items illustrate that respondents view higher shares of ethnic minorities as en improvement etc.).] 
Before running the measurement model of all nostalgic and populist measures, the nostalgia items were examined more closely in a separate analysis (see [Online Compendium](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md)).^[This is done as these measures have thus far not been used in much of political science or political communication literature. A confimatory factor analysis of the nostalgic items overall offers the expected results: The Nostalgic items that refer to media and entertainment load together on one factor, while the items that would suggest either a more reluctant/nationalistic or progressive attitude (depending on the value of the response) are split into two separate factors which significantly and positively correlate with each other.]

The PCA loadings (covariance) demonstrate that for each latent construct two indicators are contributing most to the measure. 
For Populist Attitudes, it is the anti-pluralist item *"what is called 'compromising' in politics is really just betraying your principles"* and the anti-establisment item *"The will of the common people should be the highest principle in politics"*. 
For Reluctant Nostalgia, it is thinking that compared to 50 years ago, the changes in ethnic diversity in Dutch villages and cities, and more immigrant and female politicians made the world to be worse of than before, i.e. being nostalgic for the times when this was not the case. 
These items already indicate some overlap with issues of which populist parties are typically issue owners.
Looking at the covariance between the latent variables, however, we do not see a high level of covariance between populist attitudes and reluctant nostalgia.
The covariance between those two is highest among the latent variables, hence higher than for the other conceptions of nostalgia, but a covariance of `0.03` is small. 
Yet, the correlations between the scales of reluctant nostalgia and populist attitudes is `0.3`, and thus more sizeable (visualized in Figure \ref{fig:mm}). 
The correlations between the other two latent conceptions of nostalgia and populist attitudes is considerably lower and not statistically significant. 
While the results of the measurement model do not uniformly conclude that populist attitudes and reluctant nostalgia exhibit the expected strong conceptual overlap, we do provide some evidence that both are tapping onto the same dimension and therefore assert that nostalgia as a concept should be inspected broader than just as a rhetorical device for populists.

```

## Who is Nostalgic for What?

Given the myriad ways in which societies undergo change, it is not uncommon for individuals to perceive the disappearance or gradual erosion of familiar ways of life across multiple dimensions. 
Empirical evidence, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:descr-nost}, supports this notion. 
Figure \ref{fig:descr-nost} presents data on both the open-ended survey question (left panel) and the nostalgic attitude items (right panel) for the full sample, as well as for left-wing, center, and right-wing oriented respondents.
Analyzing Figure \ref{fig:descr-nost}, it becomes evident that right-wing respondents experience more nostalgia than the other ideological groups.
Looking at the full sample's open-ended responses (left-pane of Figure \ref{fig:descr-nost}), the most prevalent narratives among respondents, when asked about the period in history they long for the most, are their own personal youth (referred to as *playful nostalgia*), a solidary and pre-polarized society  (referred to as *progressive nostalgia*). 
These narratives are mentioned by approx. `30%` of the participants in our sample. 
In contrast, only a small fraction of participants (`5%` or less) mention narratives associated with *reluctant nostalgia*, such as *nationalism*, *colonialism*, or *Euroskepticism*.^[We have also compared populist voters to all voters. In this comparison, we see that all narratives on nostalgia are present, and can be observed more or less in the same frequency for populist voters. Nonetheless, the reluctant nostalgia items seem to be a bit more frequently mentioned by populist voters. An independent t-test confirms this: Populist voters are more likely to mention a reluctant nostalgic narrative than non-populist voters; respectively `19%` vs. `7%`, `p-value <.05`.] 
Examining the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:descr-nost}, which showcases the frequency of nostalgic attitude items ranked as having "made life worse" by respondents, we observe a similar  pattern compared to the open-ended narratives. 
The right panel reveals that the majority of participants consider the progressive nostalgic items "more economic inequality" and "fewer working-class politicians" as negative developments. 
Nevertheless, similar to the responses to the open-ended questions, we observe consistent patterns of nostalgic attitudes across all respondents and even among those who support populist parties.^[Also here, we see that populist voters are more likely to rate items that are aligning with reluctant nostalgia as "*Make life worse*" than other voters; respectively `36%` vs. `19%`, `p-value <.05` based on an independent t-test.] 
These descriptive findings suggest that all voters possess some level of affinity towards certain forms of nostalgia. 
Consequently, political parties could potentially enhance the resonance of their messages by leveraging this rhetorical strategy. 
Furthermore, it is evident that certain types of nostalgia resonate more strongly with specific segments of voters due to conceptual overlap.

Looking into the profiles of the nostalgic voters,
we see that about fifteen percent of the male respondents report narratives that can be seen as reluctant -- i.e. the time in history they most long for can be classified as colonial, nationalistic or euroskeptic -- whereas only six percent of women report such narratives. 
The biggest categories for men, however, is a tie between their personal youth (`27.7%`) and a solidary society (`27.6%`).
For women, it is a tie between the time that the country was not as polarized (`31%`) and the country was still a solidary society (`30.7%`).
Longing for the pre-industrialized times is most popular among the respondents between the age of 20 and 40, whereas longing for a solidary society and one's youth is most popular under voters between 50 an 70. 
Longing for one's personal youth is also most popular in that age category.
Reluctant nostalgic narratives is most popular among voters with medium levels of education, living in medium to non-urbanized areas in the north and west of the country.
Reluctant nostalgia (colonialism, eurosceptisicm, and nationalism) is more popular among those who identify as more right-wing, whereas the average of the other types of nostaglia are more or less equaly distributed across the ideological spectrum, with an average of `5` -- the exact middle point.

include_graphics(here("report/figures/descr-4.png"))
```

Delving more into *what* people say in their the nostalgic narratives, it is remarkable to see that people long for both very defined moments in the past, such as the Fall of the Berlin Wall on the ninth of November in 1989 or Mandela's prison release on the eleventh of February 1990, as well as for less defined moments in time, such as the Post WW-II times in the Netherlands (*Wederopbouw*), the time before Social Media had seemingly penetrated our society, or before the Russian invasion in Ukraine. 
This not only shows a differentiation in times in history, but also in how defined we remember the past. 
Regardless of the concreteness of the moment, most people have a romanticized view on the past. 
For example, the people who long back for the Post WW-II times in which the country had to reconstruct itself, mention the positive mentality that permeated society, without mentioning the economic hardship that most Dutch actually went through during that time.  Statistics of that time show that the average spendable income was more than 15k a year lower than it is today. 
Such findings resonate with what @shiller2020narrative has called economic narratives: Objectively societies collectively have never been wealthier than they are today, yet the stories that drive economic events seem to tell a different tale. 
The same holds for those who long for the times when the Guilder was still the Dutch national currency -- this is a romanticized idea of wealth, as the Dutch society is a net-earner for the Euro transition.

Another prominent example for the data in which romanticizing and cherry-picking in the past occurs is that both left-wing and right-wing long back for the times when both the people as well as the state cared for fellow citizens. 
Some people refer to defined political moments, such as enacting policies or laws to dismantle the welfare state, others refer to cabinets, or just to a "time when". 
People long for the time that society was so safe and communal that locking your house was not needed, and also for times of the height of the Dutch welfare state, juxtaposing this with the dismantling thereof under neo-liberal policy choices. 
While this seems like a rather left-wing position, scholars [e.g. see @reeskens2012disentangling; @careja2022thirty] have shown that sometimes this longing for welfare distribution is based on so-called welfare chauvinism -- referring to the perception of immigrants as less deserving of welfare compared to natives. 
This welfare chauvinism can be more commonly observed among populist supporters. 
This indicates that nostalgic rhetoric is also utilized as a "dog whistle"; i.e. using suggestive language in political messaging to garner support from a particular group without provoking opposition [@bonikowski2023populism].

A third prominent narrative refers to the pre Social Media area. 
People indicate that they long for the times before polarization and social unrest, expressing that before the advent of Social Media, it was possible to enter a meaningful conversation instead of the current online public spaces that are noisy, overcrowded fora where no meaningful conversation can be held. 
This resonates with recent studies [@nematzadeh2019information; @cotter2022judging] on how people experience online platforms, in which they are often exposed to too much information to process. This phenomenon is coined *information cacophony*. 
The jarring noise of many, discordant voices offering up information, under conditions of low media trust and an absence of a pre-defined epistemic hierarchy of sources, makes it difficult for people to know what to believe. 
@cotter2022judging demonstrate that people's strategies for evaluating information are deeply entangled with the sociality and emotionality of the experience of information cacophony.

## Is Nostalgia a Persuasive Rhetorical Style for Political Parties?

To test whether nostalgia is an effective campaign strategy, we present the results of our experiment. 
Figure \ref{fig:results-treatment} shows the distribution and the average support of the message per experimental treatment.
The distributions indicate that, on average, all messages were liked -- with a score of `7` or higher and a distribution tilted to the upper-end of the scale. 
However, we also see that messages containing a scapegoat, regardless of being combined with a nostalgic message or not, are liked less than messages without one. 

```{r results-treatment, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "\\label{fig:results-treatment}Support for Nostalgic Messages", out.width="85%"}
include_graphics(here("report/figures", "treatment-view-1.png"))
```

To test H3, Figure \ref{fig:results-h1} demonstrates the effectiveness of a nostalgic campaign message.
The upper-panel of the Figure shows the results of the pre-registered experiment and the lower-panel shows the exploratory heterogeneous effects. 
Compared to messages that neither have a nostalgic framing nor mention a scapegoat, all other rhetorical styles were significantly less popular. 
The effect size of the different treatment groups differ.
The smallest effect size comes from the nostalgic message without a scapegoat, while statistically different from the "plain" message, with a coefficient of `-0.3`.
The biggest effect size can be seen with the nostalgic message with a scapegoat, with a coefficient of `-1.1`. 
As a robustness check, we have conducted the same analysis without the centrist, as they where forced into the conservative treatment.
The results, reported in the [Online Compendium](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nostalgia-populism-6B2D/README.md), are not affected by this choice.

Looking deeper at potential ideological differences in support for nostalgic messages, the lower-panel of Figure \ref{fig:results-h3} shows that for right-wing, conservative, and populist voters, the nostalgic message without a scapegoat is liked to the same extend as the plain message -- i.e. no statistical significant difference was found. 
For left-wing, progressive, and non-populist voters, the effects are similar to the main effect presented in the upper-panel of the Figure.
Hence, we do not find evidence for our third hypothesis that nostalgically framed political messages increase support for the message vis-a-vis non-nostalgically framed political messages.

```{r results-h1, out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "\\label{fig:results-h3}Support for Nostalgic Messages"}
include_graphics(here("report/figures", "viz-h3-1.png"))
```

We also, however, explored a different set of dependent variables, asking respondents which message would be the the best campaign message for oneself, the Dutch voters, and your ideological congruent group of voters (either left-wing progressive or right-wing conservative). 
The results hereof, presented in Figure \ref{fig:results-dv2}, show that actually, nostalgic campaign messages (with and without a scapegoat) are liked more for the ideological in-group as well as for the respondent, albeit not being statistically significant.
Non-nostalgic ones with a scapegoat are, however, liked less compared to the plain messages -- but also this effect is not significant.
The lower-panel of Figure \ref{fig:results-dv2} shows that mainly left-wing and progressive voters do not like a plain message with a scapegoat.

# Conclusion

Nostalgic narratives takes center-stage in political communication, whether that is populist claiming that to regain former glory we need to go back to a more homogeneous society -- a not so subtle dog whistle for anti-immigration and discriminatory policies -- or left-wing politicians defending anti-globalist stances by appealing to a desire to "return to community".
Most research examining the role of nostalgia in political communication zoom in on the relationship with populism.
We identify two problems in this line of research, both rooted in the measurement of nostalgia; i.e. conceptual overlap between the used measurement of nostalgia and populism through nationalism as a confounding concept and the collusion of nostalgic rhetoric and issue position by scapegoating a societal group (e.g. immigrants). 

To overcome this measurement issue, we show that we need a broader conceptualization of nostalgia to understand nostalgia's role in political communication.
We leveraged a novel data set (van der Velden 2023) to conduct three studies: 1) employing measurement models; 2) using qualitative content analysis; and 3) coducting an experiment. 
By using a multi-dimensional measure of nostalgia, tested and validated in the fields of sociology and marketing studies [@pickering2006modalities; @may2017belonging; @hartmann2019nostalgia], we demonstrate that indeed voters of populist parties score higher on reluctant nostalgia, but across the ideological spectrum people hold especially playful and progressive nostalgic feelings.
This means that previous work that linked populism to nostalgia seems to take only into account a specific type of nostalgia, while other types of nostalgia might be more relevant for left-wing politics.
Moreover, by separating the nostalgic rhetoric from the scapegoating messages, we show that overall respondents like nostalgic messages, but not more so than non-nostalgic messages. 
Messages explicitly mentioning a scapegoat reduce support for messages, although less so in the case of populist respondents.
This could have to do with the fact that populism carries scapegoating in its core [@mudde2004populist].

This article makes two broader contributions.
First, our findings indicate that we cannot understand the central role nostalgia plays in political communication by using the common but more narrow definition of collective nostalgia [@smeekes2015longing; @sedikides2019sociality; @wohl2020longing].
Given the myriad ways in which societies undergo change, it is not uncommon for individuals to perceive the disappearance or gradual erosion of familiar ways of life across multiple dimensions.
We therefore expand the current understanding of nostalgia by incorporating three levels; reluctant, progressive, and playful nostalgia. 
We show the importance of assessing measurement validity [@adcock2001measurement], especially discriminant validity, when drawing conclusions about the empirical relationships between two phenomena.
Our findings thus underscore the complex interplay between nostalgia and political ideologies, shedding light on how individuals' emotional connections to the past can influence their political attitudes which we cannot empirically observe with the narrow measurement of collective nostalgia.

The second contribution is linked to political persuasion and the impact of nostalgic messages on political campaigns. 
Using nostalgic rhetoric is a form of employing symbols in politics [@dinas2024; @rozenas2022real; @lupu2003memory; @forest2011monumental].
Moreover, it further shows how politicians can play with the temporal component in their communication [@muller2022temporal].
This underscores the importance of understanding reference point framing in political communication.
By playing with a point in history as a reference, different sentiments get mobilized across the ideological spectrum.
Yet, it always evokes a desire for communty, which is a core element of democratic citizenship [@blajer2023conceptualizing].
Moreover, our experiment unveils that people tend to believe that others who share their sentiments will be persuaded by nostalgic messages, but they themselves are not swayed by such messages. 
This finding aligns with the concept of the third-person effect in communication and psychology [@davison1983third; @gunther1991we], highlighting a discrepancy between how individuals perceive the influence of nostalgic content on themselves and on others. 
In a rapidly changing society everyone can feel comforted by a nostalgic yearning for the past [@ballard2024trade; @sedikides2018finding; @routledge2011past]. 
At the same time, @szabo2022sharing shows that nostalgic messages may not be as efficient in terms of user engagement and response as previously thought
This insight into the third-person effect underscores the importance of considering individual differences and psychological biases in the design of political campaigns.

An important implication of our research is the revelation that the widespread adoption of nostalgic narratives by populist actors could stem from a misperception of these narratives as more effective than other rhetorical strategies. 
This insight is crucial, given that evidence links reluctant nostalgia not only to increased resentment between social groups [@smeekes2015longing] but also to adverse effects on personal well-being [@sedikides2008nostalgia], and an amplification of existential threats [@juhl2010fighting].
Building on these findings, we invite future researchers to examine the extent to which not only populist actors but also mainstream political parties and media outlets employ nostalgia, including its playful and progressive variants, to engage and attract voters.
The differential impacts of these nostalgia types on societal cohesion and individual well-being merit closer investigation.
