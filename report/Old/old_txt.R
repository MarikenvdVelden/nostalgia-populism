Since the 1990s, much of Western Europe has been witnessing an initially sudden, but continuous rise of populist parties. 
According to Mudde (2007), populist radical right parties have become the most consistently successful new party family in Western Europe after World War II. 
With recent elections of populist leaders in the US and Italy, as well as populist parties increasing or solidifying in countries like Sweden, Germany, or France (Silver, 2022), it becomes evident that today’s social, political and media landscapes strongly favor this populist surge (Mudde, 2016). 

Considering that there is no reason to expect a subdual of this development any time soon, it comes as no surprise that the literature on populism is vast (Mudde, 2007). 
Populism is understood as a thin-centered ideology that rarely exists on its own, attaches itself to a broader “host” ideology and is thus context-sensitive (Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2013). 
In accordance with a Manichean tension, society is considered to be ultimately divided into two homogenous and antagonistic groups: the “pure, virtuous people” that finds itself in a clash with the “corrupt, malevolent elite” (Akkerman et al., 2014; Mudde, 2004; Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2012). 
Aside from defining populism, a large share of the literature has explored the sudden and increasing rise of populism (Mudde, 2007), the effect of populist parties on established party systems in Europe (Meléndez & Kaltwasser, 2019; Mudde, 2014), the similarities and differences of populist parties in different contexts (Bowler et al., 2017; Ivarsflaten, 2008; March, 2017; Mudde, 2013; Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2011), the traits and characteristics of citizens who support populist parties (Akkerman et al., 2014; Bakker et al., 2016; Bakker et al., 2021; Jacobs et al., 2018), as well as the political communication of populist actors (Hameleers et al., 2018; Jagers, 2007; Rico et al., 2017; Schumacher et al., 2022).

In recent years, notable interest in the relationship between populism and nostalgia has emerged in the field of political science and political communication. Nostalgia, which entails a sentimental longing for a collective past and the way society used to be (Cheung et al., 2017), has been shown to be linked to several attitudes and behaviors in relation to social groups. 
These include in-group favoring action such as collective action, and outgroup-directed anger, for instance (Cheung et al., 2017). 
There has been an increase in literature linking insights on populism and populist communication with those on nostalgia. 
Lammers and Baldwin (2020) argue that many right-wing populists use slogans that appeal to collective nostalgic emotions by calling for a return to the glorious past. Based on several studies relying on survey or experimental designs, the current literature suggests that exposure to populist rhetoric increases feelings of nostalgia, which in turn is associated with increased populist attitudes (Elçi, 2022; van Prooijen et al., 2022; Smeekes et al., 2021).
An important commonality of these studies to note is that they all make use of the measurements of collective nostalgia as proposed by Smeekes et al. (2015), which partially resemble Akkerman et al.’s (2014) measures of populist attitudes in their phrasing and could therefore potentially capture different dimensions of the same concept. 

Many of these studies have focused on examples from the populist radical right.
We argue that this is a compelling rationale to reconsider and reevaluate some of these studies and their findings. 
The aim of this is to examine the current way nostalgia is conceptualized and measured. 
Despite there being evidence that nostalgia may be experienced on both sides of the ideological spectrum (Stefaniak et al., 2021), the study contends that this skewness of scholarly attention may be in part due to significant overlaps between the measures of collective nostalgia on the one hand, and nativism/nationalism, relative deprivation, and populism on the other hand.

Based on survey data from the Netherlands, we first employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to empirically investigate and confirm this hypothesized overlap. In subsequent steps, Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is used to gain a better understanding on the relationship between populist and nostalgic attitudes. These findings are then further substantiated by multinomial logistic regression analysis to identify different profiles of respondents. 
The results indicate that there is considerable overlap between the aforementioned concepts and imply that the relationship between nostalgia and populism may not be as straightforward as initially suspected. [**ADD other two results**]

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the concept of nostalgia among scholars of political science and political communication. 
In psychology, nostalgia is understood as a feeling at the individual level; an affectionate longing for one’s childhood or adolescence (Marchegiani & Chau, 2013). 
In the social sciences, however, the focus has been on collective nostalgia. Defined as sentimental or affectionate feelings predicated on thinking of oneself as a group member that are based on idealistic conceptions of events or that group’s past, collective nostalgia may focus on events that were directly experienced with ingroup members (Baldwin et el., 2018). 
In many cases, these events are remembered through collective memory and thus passed down within families, learned through books or narrated by the mass media (Kao, 2012). 
Collective nostalgia is more likely to emerge when people perceive their group as better off in the past than in the present (Cheung et al., 2017). 
Though it is rather abstract at times, collective nostalgia also tends to be more consistent among individuals within the same generation of the same cultural group (Kao, 2012). 

Studies imply that collective nostalgia meets the conceptual criteria of group level emotions to an extent that it motivates and regulates attitudes and behaviors in relation to social groups. 
As Baldwin et al. (2018) argue, collective nostalgia can promote beliefs that elevate the perceived superiority and exclusivity of one’s ingroup, which benefits positive ingroup attitudes and prosociality (Behler et al., 2021).
Collective nostalgia is further connected to outgroup-directed anger and contempt (Cheung et al., 2017). 
Stefaniak et al. (2021) demonstrate that collective nostalgia is experienced on both sides of the ideological spectrum, though it is experienced differently. While liberals have a more openness-focused sense of collective nostalgia, conservatives’ sense of collective nostalgia is more homogeneity-focused.
It is the latter that shows to be a stronger predictor for intergroup attitudes (Stefaniak et al., 2021). 
It is argued that this stronger association between conservative ideology and collective nostalgia is due to an intuitive preference for political ideas that maintain or even return society to how it was (Lammers & Baldwin, 2020).
Furthermore, conventional measures of collective nostalgia as introduced by Smeekes et al. (2015) include survey items that repeatedly reference the nation and national society, and much of the literature has since relied on these measures. 

## Populism, Populist Rhetoric, and Nostalgia


While these findings are seemingly compelling, a closer look is warranted at both the measures and the design of some of the studies in question. 
As Adcock and Collier (2001) argue, there are considerable degrees of freedom as researchers make complex decisions regarding measuring concepts. Measurement validity is achieved when a chosen measurement or indicator meaningfully corresponds with the respective concept (Bollen, 2011). When examining the measures of collective nostalgia introduced by Smeekes et al., (2015), it should be noted that the survey items make repeated references to the Dutch people and society of the past. These items could not only overlap with feelings of nativism/nationalism and relative deprivation, but also present the Dutch society and people as homogenous. This strongly resembles the ideational approach to conceptualizing populism (Mudde, 2004), which is reflected by the measurements introduced by Akkerman et al. (2014). This potential theoretical overlap should urge us to reconsider the current evidence regarding the effects of nostalgia on populist attitudes. If some of the measures may capture different dimensions of the same concept, then we should deem some of the findings potentially tautological in nature.
